# Task-Management-system-
The task management system is a digital tool designed to help individuals, teams, or organizations efficiently organize, prioritize, and track tasks and projects. This system is crucial for enhancing productivity, maintaining accountability, and ensuring that deadlines are met consistently. It serves as a centralized platform where users can create, assign, monitor, and update tasks and projects. It typically offers a range of features such as task creation, due date setting, priority levels, progress tracking, collaboration tools, and reporting capabilities.
The Task Management System is a straightforward project designed to assist a specific company in monitoring the progress of its project tasks. The system caters to three distinct types of users: the Admin, Project Manager, and Regular Employee. Admin users possess comprehensive access to all data stored within the system's database, particularly in creating and overseeing system users. Project Managers, on the other hand, are responsible for overseeing project details and advancements within their designated projects. Regular Employees are tasked with submitting their work productivity for each task within the project. This entails providing the start and end time range of their work on a given task. This information is crucial for generating reports that outline project members' work duration.

#How the System Works
In the Task Management System, only admin users have the authority to create new users. Initially, either the admin user or Project Managers are responsible for initiating a new project, providing essential details and user references. During project creation, it's mandatory for the admin or project managers to enlist all employees assigned to handle tasks within the project. Once the project is established, regular employees are solely permitted to input their progress for the tasks assigned to them. They have the privilege to edit only the progress data they've submitted. As employees continuously update the system with their progress, project managers review or scan their activities to assess whether a particular task is complete, subsequently updating the task status in the system. Access to printable reports within the system is restricted to admin users and project managers only.
